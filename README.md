# Should I shoot or should I go? Simple rules for prey selection in multi-species hunting systems

## *Dietary thresholds to manage hunting*

This repository presents replication code and data for Chang &amp; Drohan (2018), *Ecological Applications*. This is simply a mirror of Data S1, which is also provided online in the *Supplementary Information*.

The contents of this data and code supplement are as follows:

* [Replication dataset](https://github.com/charlottehchang/HunterDiets/blob/master/SWChinaReplicationData.RData)
    + This dataset contains 2 functions: `res.function` and `res.function.dsct` to perform the optimal stopping dietary model.
    + It also contains 3 pieces of data: `catch.biomass` (a numeric vector of body sizes observed in hunter bags in Southwest China), `SWChinaRepData` (wildlife observations at point count and sign survey locations), and `xsbn.null` (comparison wildlife observations from a well-protected Core Zone).
* [Replication code](https://github.com/charlottehchang/HunterDiets/blob/master/ChangDrohan_SI.Rmd) in both Rmarkdown and [pdf](https://github.com/charlottehchang/HunterDiets/blob/master/ChangDrohan_SI.pdf) formats.
